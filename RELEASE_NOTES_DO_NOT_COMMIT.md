Hi everyone!

We are happy to announce the release of Babeltrace 2.0.0-rc1.

# What's new since 2.0-pre5?
## New features
### Source automatic discovery

# Avant

This feature of the CLI and of the Python bindings allows the user to pass
input strings (which can be of an arbitrary format understood by a particular
component class, or paths to files/directories) and for babeltrace to figure
out which source component classes are best suited to handle those inputs. To
be considered in the automatic discovery process, component classes need to
implement the `babeltrace.support-info` query. Source component classes that
don't support it will not be able to automatically discover inputs, and will
have to be explicitly instantiated using the `--component` option.


# Apr√®s

This new feature makes it possible for you to provide a path, URI, or an
arbitrary string and let Babeltrace determine the component class that is
best suited for that input configuration string. In effect, this allows you
to omit the explicit `--component` option most of the time.

Behind the scenes, this feature makes use of the `babeltrace.support-info`
query through which component classes can provide a confidence score
indicating their ability to handle a given input string.

For instance, a CTF file-system source will attempt to interpret the
user-provided string as a path and check for a CTF trace at that location.
If a CTF trace is found, the source component class will report that it
can handle that request and be elected as the source.

While automatic source discovery is performed by the `babeltrace` client
application, it is also possible to make use of the mechanism through
the C and Python APIs making it easy to integrate this functionality into
other tools.

Note that source component classes do not have to implement the
`babeltrace.support-info` query. When the query is left unimplemented, the
source component class is not considered by the automatic discovery
algorithm. If you wish to use a source component class that does not
implement this query, the `--component` option has to be used explicitly.

### Simple sink component class
The goal of this new component class is to make it easy to process messages at
the sink endpoint of a graph. The user may provide callback functions when
instantiating a component of that class, which get called at various moments
during the execution of the graph. These callbacks are:

  * Initialize (optional): Called once during the initialization phase of the
    graph.

  * Consume: Called for each batch of messages received by the component. This
    is where messages are processed.

  * Finalize (optional): Called once during the finalization phase of the
    graph.


### Support for future CTF 2 field and field types
Some new field classes were added to Babeltrace in order to support the new
field types that are expected to be introduced by CTF 2.  These field classes
are:

* Boolean: Used to represent trivial boolean value.

* Bit array: Used to represent an array of bits. This is useful to represent
  CPU status or flag register values. Unlike integer field classes, bit arrays
  are not interpreted as numerical values.

* Option: Used to represent an optional field. It is equivalent to a variant
  containing an arbitrary field and a second, zero-sized field.

### User attributes
The CTF 2 metadata is expected to contain user attributes, which are map values
attached to the various objects (such as traces, streams and events). To
support this, Babeltrace allows components to attach user-defined attributes to
the various trace IR objects.

### Error reporting API
In case of error, the error reporting API allows the different actors of the
library to precisely describe the chain of events that lead to that error. It
is then possible for the library user to access this list of causes, which
helps troubleshooting problems. This is similar to a stack trace carried by an
exception object in other languages.

When an error occurs when using the CLI, the error and all its causes are
printed:

```

      raise Exception
  Exception
```

### Message Interchange Protocol version
As Babeltrace evolves, new concepts (message types, methods, message ordering
requirements, etc.) may be added to the trace IR. To ensure forward and
backward compatibility, the concept of Message Interchange Protocol (MIP) was
introduced. When a breaking changes happen in the protocol, the MIP version
will be increased so to express new requirements. Component classes can report
which versions of the protocol they support, ensuring that all components in a
graph understand each other.

### `sink.text.details` component class
Components of that class print information about all the messages they receive
in a detailed and deterministic way. This is useful while developing and for
testing other component classes.

### Support for lttng-crash and malformed CTF traces
Some versions of LTTng-UST, LTTng-Modules, and barectf tracers may produce, in
some occasions, traces that are non-compliant with the CTF specification. The
`src.ctf.fs` component class now fixes up those non-compliant traces as best it
can so they can be read as the user would expect.

## API changes

### Const classes in `bt2` Python package
Since the Python language does not allow expressing the same const-correctness
as the C API does, the Python classes representing the types of the API were
split in const and non-const versions. Non-const versions of the object provide
methods for mutating the objects, while the const versions do not.

### Co-installation with Babeltrace 1.x
In order to facilitate the transition from Babeltrace 1.x to 2.x, the following
changes were made in order to make it possible to co-install both release
series of Babeltrace:
* Rename the CLI tool to `babeltrace2`.
* Rename the include directory to `babeltrace2`.
* Rename the library to `libbabeltrace2`.

### Packets are now optional
It's now optional for the streams of a given stream class to support the
concept of packets. Sources that don't have the concept of
grouping events into packets no longer have to create artificial packets to
emit events.

### Rename VERBOSE log level to TRACE
The VERBOSE log level has been renamed to TRACE.

# What's new since 1.5
## Trace processing graphs
Babeltrace 2.0 introduces the concept of trace processing graphs. Such graphs
consist of multiple reusable components connected together, which lets users
address their various different trace reading and analyzing needs.

## Provided component classes
Babeltrace 2.0 provides the following component classes out of the box:
* **CTF filesystem source (source.ctf.fs)**: Read CTF traces from the file system.
* **LTTng live source (source.ctf.lttng-live)**: Read CTF traces from the network
    using the `lttng-live` protocol.
* **Dmesg source (source.text.dmesg)**: Read `dmesg`-style log file from the file
    system or standard input.
* **Trace trimmer (filter.utils.trimmer)**: Keep messages that occur within a
    specific time range.
* **Trace muxer (filter.utils.muxer)**: Sort messages from multiple sources to
    a single output port by time.
* **Debug information filter (filter.lttng-utils.debug-info)**: Augment compatible
    events with debugging information.
* **CTF filesystem sink (sink.ctf.fs)**: Write CTF traces to the file system.
* **Text pretty-printer (sink.text.pretty)**: Pretty print messages.
* **Dummy sink (sink.utils.dummy)**: Consume messages and discard them.
* **Counter sink (sink.utils.counter)**: Count messages and print the results.
* **Details sink (sink.text.details)**: Print messages with all available details.

## Reading of multiple CTF traces with same UUID
Babeltrace now treats multiple input CTF traces that share the same UUID as a
single trace. This is especially useful for reading traces produced with the
tracing session rotation feature introduced by LTTng 2.11.

## Developer mode
When Babeltrace 2 is built in this mode, a large number of checks are added to
enforce most preconditions required by the API.

This makes it easier to develop and test new plugins while ensuring that they
honour the contract of the various functions they use. Since components are now
assumed to have been tested in this mode by their authors, the release
configuration of Babeltrace 2 can eschew most precondition checks at run time,
resulting in improved performance.

To build Babeltrace 2 in this mode and test your own plugins, set the
`BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE` environment variable `1` at configure time, for
example:

    BABELTRACE_DEV_MODE=1 ./configure

## Colors
The Babeltrace CLI now use colors whenever the standard output is an
interactive terminal. Plugin developers can use `bt_common_colors_supported()`
to know is this feature is supported and use the `bt_common_color_*()`
functions to change background and foreground colors as well as boldness.

## LTTng live "subscribe" mode
It is now possible to connect to a LTTng-Relay daemon in "subscribe" mode. To
achieve this a `src.ctf.lttng-live` must be instantiated with the
`session-not-found-action="continue"` parameter. In this mode, the source will
attempt to consume an LTTng relay daemon's session and retry periodically if
the session does not exist.

This is in contrast with the default Babeltrace 1.X behaviour which will exit
(with success) immediately if the session to consume does not exist on the
LTTng relay daemon.

The following command demonstrates the use of this new mode:

babeltrace2 net://relayhost/host/tgthost/my-session \
           --params='session-not-found-action="continue"'

## API changes
The API has been entirely been revamped.
